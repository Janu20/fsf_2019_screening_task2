This file is on how to install anaconda in the system
Open anaconda.org website and go to downloads, select an operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac) and select version of Python (2.7 or 3.7)
Click on download option (file size is around 630 MB)
After it gets downloaded, double click in the executable file(doenloaded file) and install it.
On successfull installation, you can see version of conda using "conda --version" on command prompt or anaconda prompt
All the files like pyqt,spyder etc., will be installed during the process of installation of anaconda. 
If we want to install any other library use "conda install library_name". Here library_name means numpy,pandas etc.,
If we try to install any library which is already present, prompt shows that it is already present. Otherwise it gets downloaded.
For any other queries watch "https://youtu.be/5mDYijMfSzs" or do post here.
